Age-Power Correlation
=====================

The older a wizard, the more powerful they get. Power is dependent on: age, wisdom, practice, knowledge, ...<br>
Different to muggles, wizards grow stronger in every aspect with age. (strength, height, hearing, sight, smell, reaction time, ...)<br>
This doesn't mean they grow younger and physically stronger with time, they stay old, weak and slow, until is comes to spontaneous magical skill expression.

Complete Power
--------------

*Complete Power* is being increased by age (*complete_power *= log(age)*). This means, the older the wizard, the more powerful all their stats get. As this increase is logarithmic, the older they get, the less powerful is the multiplier (without maths: the older they get, the slower they increase in all skills). A wizard makes more progress from age 10 to 20 than from age 250 to 260.

Height
------

Wizard's grow their whole life. They roughly follow log<sub>7</sub>(*x*), where *x* is the age. The normal fluctuations between human beings stays (so roughly +-20cm).

- Age 10 -> ~1.2m
- Age 20 -> ~1.5m
- Age 40 -> ~1.9m
- Age 50 -> ~2.0m
- Age 75 -> ~2.2m
- Age 100 -> ~2.4m
- Age 150 -> ~2.6m
- Age 200 -> ~2.7m
- Age 250 -> ~2.8m
- Age 300 -> ~2.9m

Life Expectancy
---------------

Probability a wizard is dead at age *x*:

(Only considering natural death)

- Age 50 -> ~0%
- Age 75 -> ~1%
- Age 85 -> ~5%
- Age 100 -> ~10%
- Age 125 -> ~30%
- Age 150 -> ~60%
- Age 175 -> ~80%
- Age 200 -> ~90%
- Age 225 -> ~95%
- Age 250 -> ~99%
- Age 275 -> ~99.9%
- Age 300 -> ~99.99%

That means, every 100th wizard makes it to 250 years, every 1000th to 275 years, and every 10000th to 300 years.

Reaction Time
-------------

Wizards reaction times decrease with age.

- Age 10 -> ~2sec
- Age 20 -> ~1.5sec
- Age 30 -> ~1sec
- Age 40 -> ~0.5sec
- Age 50 -> ~0.1sec
- Age 60 -> ~0sec
- Age 70 -> ~0.1sec future
- Age 80 -> ~0.25sec future
- Age 90 -> ~0.5sec future
- Age 100 -> ~1sec future
- Age 200 -> ~2sec future
- Age 300 -> ~3sec future

Don't think of these reaction times as a 300 year old grandpa catching a fly with chopsticks. Think of it as a shift in the air before a storm breaks, or an echo of something that's yet to happen. It is a deeply magical awareness, like an intuition or a sense.
