Maya
====

The Mayans were a magical high culture, they are now extinct.

Time Magic
----------

The Mayans practices time magic, which means, their spells could manipulate time. They were thus able, to move through time semi-freely.


- Ritual:
	- Month to Years in time
	- Dances
	- Sacrifices such as food or animals
	- Feasts, festives, substance abuse
	- Building of temples
- Medium: None
- Emotion: Exuberance

The complexity of the Mayan spells consisted of the complex interplay between high-spirited festives and play as part of a particular, very precise ritual. This intertwined concept between exuberance and particular and precise timing and execution of the other rituals (dances, sacrifices, architecture) made the Mayan rituals the most complex in the history of magic.
